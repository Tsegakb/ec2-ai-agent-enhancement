An AI assist that  identify EC2 instance IDs, and provide conversational remediation assistance to DevOps engineers. And that powers ON the instance that is linked to the given incident number.
An enhanced EC2 remediation system that combines manual control with AI Agent automation, enabling proactive detection, intelligent response, and streamlined resolution of EC2 instance issues. The system leverages AI tools for auto-remediation while allowing manual override and approval workflows for critical actions.

Implementation Steps
Tool Scope Definition
Define which remediation tasks are automated (e.g., reboot, stop, tag EC2).
Limit AI Agent access to non-critical actions unless approved.
Script Tool Implementation
Manual Override Workflow
Log AI actions for auditability.
Agent-Tool Mapping (sn_aia_agent_tool_m2m)
Ensure all AI Tools are correctly linked to the AI Agent.
include these links in update sets for portability.
Fallback Mechanisms
Allow seamless fallback to manual remediation if the AI fails or confidence is low.

 Comparative analysis of manual vs AI Agent approaches - when to use each method, efficiency differences, and architectural trade

 The manual approach to EC2 remediation is best suited for complex or high-risk scenarios that require human judgment, such as handling unknown issues or working on critical systems. While it offers greater flexibility and control, it is slower, less scalable, and more prone to human error. In contrast, the AI Agent approach excels in efficiency and scalability, making it ideal for repetitive, low-risk, and well-understood tasks. It enables faster resolution through automated detection and scripted tools, with built-in logging for auditability. However, it requires upfront architectural investmentâ€”such as defining tools, configuring agent-tool relationships, and establishing fallback mechanisms. The choice between the two depends on 
 the nature of the task: use manual methods for nuanced decisions, and AI Agents for standardized, automatable workflows.


 Use Manual Remediation via ServiceNow UI when:
The issue is complex, unfamiliar, or impacts critical production systems.
Human validation or approvals are required before taking action.
You need full control over parameters and execution.
Use AI Agent Conversation (via Virtual Agent or chat platforms) when:
The issue is routine (e.g., EC2 reboot, tagging, stopping idle instances).
A predefined, tested script tool is available for automated handling.
Speed and scale are priorities, and risk is low.
